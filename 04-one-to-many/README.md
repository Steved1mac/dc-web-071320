# One to Many Relationships

## Objectives

* Implement one object to many objects relationship
  * One object has many objects
  * One object belongs to another object
* Practice passing custom objects as arguments to methods
* Demonstrate single source of truth
* Infer type of method (class or instance) through naming conventions

## Deliverables

* Create a `School` class. The class should have these methods:
  <!-- * `School#initialize` which takes a name -->
  <!-- * `School#name` which returns the name of the School as a string -->
  <!-- * `School#students` that returns an array of Student instances -->
  <!-- * `School#roster` that returns an array of strings of Students' names who go to that school -->
  * `School#enroll_student` that takes a Student and adds them to the roster

* Create a `Student` class. The class should have these methods:
  <!-- * `Student#name` that returns a string -->
  <!-- * `Student#school` that returns an instance of the School class -->
  <!-- * `Student#school_name` that returns the name of the School as a string -->
  <!-- * `Student.all` that returns all the Students created. -->
  <!-- * `Student.find_by_name` which takes a string and returns the first student whose name matches (Bonus:  Make it case insensitive) -->
